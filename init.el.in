 ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.

;; If ~/.emacs.local is available load it as the last file so that it is
;; possible to add local settings and overrides.
